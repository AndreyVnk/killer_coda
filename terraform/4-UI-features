1. Start Vault with UI

# Start the Vault server with the UI enabled:
$ mkdir -p /opt/vault/data
$ cd /opt/vault

# Create a config file for vault that starts it and lets the server know where to store the raft data:
tee config.hcl <<EOF
ui = true
disable_mlock = true

storage "raft" {
  path    = "/opt/vault/data"
  node_id = "node1"
}

listener "tcp" {
  address     = "0.0.0.0:8200"
  tls_disable = "true"
}

api_addr = "http://127.0.0.1:8200"
cluster_addr = "https://127.0.0.1:8201"
EOF


# Verify everything looks correct:
$ cat /opt/vault/config.hcl

# Start the server with the config file:
$ vault server -config=config.hcl &

# Verify that the server is listening on the proper ports:
$ lsof -i :8200
$ ss -ntulp | grep 820

# Connect to the port and verify that the server is running

2. Using UI Mode to navigate Vault

# In your UI choose to "Create a new Raft Cluster"
# Enter 5 in Key shares and 3 in Key thresholds
# Click Initialize

# You will see the unseal keys and must select to download them. They will become a .json doc in your downloads folder. It should look like this
# You will unseal the vault using 3 of the 5 keys. (Any 3 will do). Repeat this step 3 times.

# Next, you must present the root token from your downloaded file.
# Once you hit "Sign In" you will be presented with the WEB UI Wizard.
