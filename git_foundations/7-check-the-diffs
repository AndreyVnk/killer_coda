1. Check the changes:
$ git diff	# this command checks HEAD by default and shows differences between commit and working directory

$ git diff HEAD~1	# modified HEAD command

$ git diff HEAD~1 testfile-01	# check diff for one file

2. Staged differences:
$ touch testfile-03 && echo "testfile-03" > testfile-03 && git add testfile-03	# created a new file and added it to staging

$ git diff 	# there is nothing about our new file

$ git diff --staged	# to see the difference between staged work and HEAD

3. Git show:
$ git show	# give you information similar to 'git log'

# 'git show' work by default against 'HEAD'
