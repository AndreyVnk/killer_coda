1. Resolve conflict:
'<<<<<<' - this is what we have in current branch

'======' = center of our conflict

'>>>>>>' - this wants to be merged / added. In our case this part is empty (as it should be).

# Normally you should use 'vim', and remove lines.

# The last thing to do is to add and commit the file again.

# There are tools which can help you to resolve conflicts. Examples are:

- git-mergetool (part of the git package, you need to specify proper tool which will be invoked)
- Plugins to your beloved editor
- Kdiff3
- Meld
