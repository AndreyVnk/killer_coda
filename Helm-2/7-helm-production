1. Helm install:
$ helm install webserver bitnami/apache --dry-run --debug

# After checking the above, we can introduce the --wait flag if set, will wait until all Pods, PVCs, Services, and minimum number of Pods of a Deployment, StatefulSet, or ReplicaSet are in a ready state before marking the release as successful. The default wait time is 5m but it can be changed with --timeout .

# Before attempting installation we need to introduce the --atomic flag, that will revert the changes if the operation is failed otherwise you'll have a partially installed chart in case of a failed release.

$ helm install webserver bitnami/apache --wait --timeout 10s --atomic --debug

2. Helm upgrade:
# Beside the flags for the install command, the "upgrade" command has the "--cleanup-on-fail" flag which will allow the deletion of the new resources introduced in the upgrade. It can be used together with the "--atomic" for reverting the release to the revision before the upgrade, because using only "--atomic" means that the resources present before the upgrade will stay the same but the newly introduced resources (if they exists) will be left dangling in the cluster.

3. Helm plugins:
# If you're serius about Helm you should check out the Helm plugins. There you'll find tools for developing, publishing and managing your Helm charts. (https://helm.sh/docs/community/related/#helm-plugins)
