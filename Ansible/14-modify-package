1. Playbook execution update packages:

# hosts
[servers]
controlplane env=prod app=db
node01 env=dev app=web

# packages_update.yaml 
---
- name: Upgrade Packages
  hosts: servers
  vars:
  gather_facts: True
  become: True
  tasks:

  - name: Upgrade all packages to the latest version
    apt:
      name: "*"
      state: latest

# commands
$ ansible-playbook -i /root/hosts /root/packages_update.yaml

2. Playbook execution to add packages based on env variables:

# packages_install.yaml
---
- name: Package install for environment
  hosts: servers
  vars:
  gather_facts: True
  become: True
  tasks:

  - name: Debug env variables just to see them
    debug:
      var: app

  - name: Install apache2 on the web server
    apt:
      pkg: 
      - apache2
      - php
      state: present
    when: '"web" in app'

  - name: Install mariadb on the web server
    apt:
      pkg: 
      - mariadb-server
      - mariadb-client
      state: present
    when: '"db" in app'

# commands
$ ansible-playbook -i /root/hosts /root/packages_install.yaml	# the second run will not change anything (idempotency works well)
